It's been a struggle. During the first week of the start of this cohort, a bad even happened in my life personally and I've been struggling to catch up with school. I love the curriculum that I've been learning, I love the support, the constant reassurance and motivation from others, etc. However, I feel like I am too behind. I am determined and motivated to finish, regardless of my current life situation. This is what I'm passionate about and this is what I'm going to stick to doing. 

I remember, a few months ago, I joined Career Karma, an app that is a community of people wanting to change their lives, pursue a new careeer, or simply discover a new passion in life. I was a mix of all three. For 21 days, I did little challenges with them to learn how to code, to prepare for coding bootscamps and to create a new habit of believing in myself. I didn't think I would ever get this far to even get accepted into one of the best coding bootscamps out there. I aspire to be great, to be able to change the world in a positive way and being a part of Flatiron School is bringing me one step closer to doing exactly that. 

I don't want to give up and I won't. I'm going to graduate from Flatiron School no matter what it takes. Mark my words.
